# Astro Platformer Game Engine [WIP]

This is an unfinished platformer game engine developed for the LÃ–VE engine.

The engine is based off the fangame SMBX which allow for user made content to be added into user made levels.

Astro creates a variety of classes such as players, NPCs, blocks, etc. and levels can quickly be developed by using base assests and custom content in a easy to use editor.

More information will be added in the future.
